# Virtual environment
A virtual environment in Python is an isolated directory that contains a specific Python interpreter and its own set of installed packages and libraries. It provides a self-contained and isolated environment for individual Python projects, preventing conflicts between different projects that might require different versions of the same package or entirely different sets of dependencies.

***Original***
